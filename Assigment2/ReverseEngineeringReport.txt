## Compromise Indicator
Most file extensions are changed to .pass and are encryped.
File icons are changed to the bitcoin logo.
Unable to varify if http connections were attempted.
A file named !!!KEYPASS_DECRYPTION_INFO!!!.txt" is created on the desktop

## Clues about orgin
The distributor of the virus may not be an native English speaker, as noted with several grammer errors in the "!!!KEYPASS_DECRYPTION_INFO!!!.txt" file 
The distributor uses a Switzerland email address as proxy, although this doesn't necessarily suggest that the command and control server is also located in Switzerland.
The backup email address uses .india extension. Same reasoning as above. 

## YARA rule
Thoughts:
While one could make Yara rule as comprehensive as possible, it is always possible to get around Yara rules. This is one of the reason why packers are useful for virus makers, as any kind of encryption would render yara rule completely useless. 
Thus while one could use Yara rule to detect virus, it would be unwise to completely rely on it. In fact, devoting too much resource into making Yara rule would be proven futile unless the target is completely incapable of adapting. (ie, worms)

The following Yara rule attempts to identify the string "!!!KEYPASS_DECRYPTION_INFO!!!" in utf-16 format

import "pe"
rule keypass_string : keypass
{
	meta: 
		description: "find !!!KEYPASS_DECRYPTION_INFO!!! in utf-16 format"
		threat_level = 3
	
	strings:
		$text = { 00 21 00 21 00 21 00 4b 00 45 00 59 00 50 00 41 00 53 00 53 00 5f 00 44 00 45 00 43 00 52 00 59 00 50 00 54 00 49 00 4f 00 4e 00 5f 00 49 00 4e 00 46 00 4f 00 21 00 21 00 21 }
		
	condition:
		$text and pe.is_pe and filesize > 2.8MB and filesize < 3MB
}
Note: windows uses utf-16 encoding, and utf-16 only support bytes in multiple of 2. (utf-8 supports single byte character)

It's unlikely that this rule would generate false positives, since it only detects an execuable containing a petty unique string that happens to be between 2.8MB and 3MB.
